# Sandbox deployments

## Getting started

Amplify gives every developer a personal cloud sandbox where they can test changes rapidly without waiting on infrastructure deployments. To get started with a new Amplify, sandbox run the following command on your local machine:

:::note
Amplify sandbox should not be used for production applications.
:::


```bash
npx amplify sandbox
```

## Creating a new sandbox environment

When you deploy a sandbox, Amplify creates a temporary CloudFormation stack `amplify-{appName}-{$whoami}-sandbox` in your AWS account via the AWS CDK with the associated resources for your backend.

After the successful deployment of the CloudFormation stack, the sandbox tracks and monitors for file changes in your backend and performs real-time updates to the CloudFormation stack using the hot capability of the AWS CDK.

## Terminating a sandbox environment

After testing all the changes associated to the backend, you can terminate the sandbox session via `Ctrl+C` and can then choose whether you want to keep or delete all the resources in the sandbox environment.

## Amplify Gen2 console

You can view and manage all the sandboxes for your gen2 apps in the [Amplify Gen2 console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/apps/sandboxes).
